Worker nodes grab repo and trade deps.

They pick a random 32bit int and start grabbing work from there.

Work is stored indexed by random 32bit int. Worker updates a taken_at and deletes on finish. Workers check for entries older than 5mins and do those first.

Workers store results and web shows those.

PoC:
 - Scrape 'Go modules' dependencies
 - Scrape Github projects for new releases

Objectives:
 - OAuth signup (allow private repos or not)
 - Grab project, get dependencies, track those updates
 - Email notify (daily, monthly, default: weekly, every other week) on new releases (like touchpine)

Shortcuts:
- Let's use moov-io/auth (with OAuth disabled) for auth handling.
  - Means we need to check x-user-id

Depth:
 - Auth
   - Github
   - Gitlab
   - Bitbucket

Dependencies:
   - Go modules
   - Dep
   - govend
   - ...
